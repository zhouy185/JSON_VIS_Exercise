# Exercise: Visualization with Open Street Map

In this exercise, we will modify the codes we used in class to show all **parks in Hamilton, Ontario on a map**.

You are provided the starter codes from our main example in class. You need to **make the necessary changes** to the code to make it work for the new context.
